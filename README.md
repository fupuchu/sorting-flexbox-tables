# sorting-flexbox-tables

A alternative to using `<tables>`

## Why ?

My main goal was to test myself on using javascript for dom manipulation(without react). The goal of this side project is to ultimately have an object to hold all the settings so you can add an unlimited amount of columns, hopefully you won't need to add 100 columns, please use Excel for that!

## To Do

- [x] Base structure of table
- [x] Javascript to populate table
- [ ] Async/await for data coming from an external source
- [ ] Add "lazyload" when you click on an item that can be expanded
- [ ] Optimizations
- [ ] Add javascript functions to handle the creation of tables on their own
